<B>1" BUTTONS!</b>

<P>
<b>General Specs</b><br>
I can manufacture small runs of normal "punk rock" 1" buttons (aka pins), 
for any purpose.  They're great for promoting bands, labels, website, or just art 
projects. The pins are metal with a standard pin back.  I can do B/W or 
full color. Single buttons are $.50 each. Ten or more buttons are $.25 each.
The buyer pays shipping.<p>
<b>Image Specs</b><br>
I have a number of button designs that I have already created, which 
you can browse for on the wrecked page.  You can also supply me with your 
original artwork.  Ideal images are at least 300 dpi, in a 
non-lossy format like .tiff, however at high resolution, a .gif or 
.jpg are acceptable. I created a photoshop .psd file that you can use as a 
template to create a button image.  The outer circle is the edge that i 
cut, and the inner circle shows the limits of what will be visible 
on the front of the button.  So make your image a layer, and center 
it within the middle circle.<br>

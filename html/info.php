	<b>this site</b><p>
    this site is the companion online shop to the wrecked distro that operates out of 
	pittsburgh, pa.  the objective of the distro and the site is to help people get a variety of new music and 
	other interesting media, as well as promote new artists and associated events that spotlight them.
    right now what i stock consists of mostly edge pushing and genre blurring
	extreme, experimental, weird or otherwise hard to find electronics.
	you can get this media off me locally iN person or at shows i vend, by mailorder through 
	<A href="mailto:sales@wrecked-distro.com">email</a>,
	or at local shops that i deal with.  if you're looking for anything that i might
	carry let me know and i can probably track it down.
	<P>
        <b>what we'd like to stock</b><br>       
        new/uncatagorizable sounds, hardcore/breakcore, experimental/noise/industrial,
        dub/dancehall/reggae, idm/electronics/ambient, robodisco/futurist electro, hiphop/triphop, rare beats/funk/jazz,
        interesting rock/post rock, found-sound/collage, spoken word, weird recordings of any kind.

	<b>why</b><br>
	there's lots of good stuff that either isn't popular enough or isn't profitable
	enough to stock in the normal local shops.  but its good and interesting,
	and hell, i at least want to get a copy for myself, so why shouldn't i get
	some more and share?  alot of these labels are putting out this music in small
	runs and don't get good distribution, so i want to get the word out, support
	independant/creative/diy production.

<b>how to order</b>
<p>

<b>where to start</b><br>
wrecked is based in pittsburgh, but we ship orders all around 
the world.  since you're already here, ordering from this site directly is the easiest 
and fastest method for getting the records you want. read 'placing an order' below
for more details about using the site. if you're
in the pittsburgh area, feel free to <a href="mailto:sales@wrecked-distro.com">drop us an email</a>
and you can come browse or pick up your records in person.  you can also
find the records we sell through one of the shops that we consign to or
at shows that we vend at in the pittsburgh area, or check the events section
to see what shows we will be vending at in the pittsburgh area or around the US when
we travel.<p>

<b>placing an order</b> <br>
the wrecked online ordering system was built from the ground up,
and functions like most other web shops. 
from the 'login' menu you can sign up for an account,
then browse the site and add what you'd like to a
'cart', then check out right from the site.<p>

if you haven't yet, take a
moment to <a href="newuser.php">sign up for a new account</a>.
there is no charge for signing up, and 
you can even browse the site without creating an account. however, you will
need to sign up and log in to your account before adding
any items to your cart.  once you have an account,
you can log in and view your current account information
through the same 'login' menu choice.<p>

next, you can browse through the catalog or search for 
artists, titles or labels you are looking for.  explore the different
menu options in the upper right for different ways of finding titles,
or just enter what you're looking for into the search box and click go. 
when you want to add an item to your cart, just click on the 'add'
link at the end of the item listing.  this doesn't obligate
you to buy anything, its just like adding to your literal
shopping cart in a real-world store. you can add and remove items at 
any time. also, if you leave the site and return, your shopping cart
will still be preserved.<p>

you can see what's in your cart by clicking on the 'check cart' 
menu.  when you are ready to check out, click on the 'check out'
menu. from there you'll be asked for a billing method, shipping method,
and be able to add any special notes.<P>

to finalize the order, click 'finish order'.  from there you'll be sent an email 
confirming that we have everything you ordered in stock, including
payment instructions.  once we receive payment from you,
we'll send you an email indicating when we've shipped your 
order.<p>

this is a new system for us - so any feedback reguarding
it is extremely appriciated!  <p>

we'll also still accept orders via email if you have a problem with the 
web-based ordering. just send
a list of what you'd like, including your address
and preferred shipping method to <a href="mailto:sales@wrecked-distro.com">sales@wrecked-distro.com</a><P>

<b>payment and shipping</b><br>
you can send money orders, checks (up to a week to clear) 
made payable to Geoff Maddock or well concealed cash to:<p>

<i>WRECKED<br>
50 pasadena street<br>
pittsburgh pa 15211<br>
usa
</i><p>

currently for secure credit card payments,
we're using the <a href="http://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">Paypal</a> service.
they have proven to be both secure and reliable.<p>

we will ship anywhere in the world - just be aware that we are in the US,
so international orders will take longer, and generally cost more.
in the US we recommend USPS Priority for fast orders, and USPS Media Rate
if you're looking for the cheapest method.  we don't include insurance
or delivery confirmation by default, but we'd gladly ad that, just include
a note, and we'll give you a price quote.  <p>   

<b>return policy</b><br>
we strive to provide the best service possible, including the
best quality media delivered in a timely manner.  however, we know
that there will inevitably be problems that arise.<p>
orders that contain incorrect items will be immediately replaced, and wrecked
will pay shipping for the buyer to return the incorrect item.   
for items that are obviously factory damaged or faulty
(a cd that doesn't play, a record that skips on every turntable)
we will accept returns for refund, credit or replacement. 
wrecked cannot be responsible for items that are damaged in shipping,
unless the buyer pays for shipping insurance.  if you have payed
for insurance and the package is damaged, please contact us immediatly
so we can begin the process of claiming the insurance.  once we recieve
payment from the shipping company, we'll repay the buyer. 
all items that are listed as used are sold as-is, and are not subject 
to return.  we will not accept returns of items simply because you 
did not like the record.
<p>please contact us within 30 days of recieving 
the order for any returns. after 30 days we will not accept any returns. 
</p>
<p>
<b>lost or missing orders</b><br>
if you find that you have placed an order, but not recieved
an email confirmation with payment information after 48 hours,
please send a followup email to <a href="mailto:sales@wrecked-distro.com">sales@wrecked-distro.com</a>
and reference your order number or username.
if you have payed for your order and not recieved your package
within the time indicated in your confirmation email, please contact
us also.  if you ordered tracking on your package, we can provide
the tracking number as well as a status on the packages location.
<i>we do not provide tracking unless it is requested.</i> if there was no tracking on the package,
we can still place a request to the post office to look for the
package.  however, there is no gauruntee that it will be found.
luckily this is a very rare circumstance, but if this is the case,
we'll try to do everything we can to have them find the package,
or issue a refund.  but the only way to be really save is through
insurance and delivery tracking.  if an order is somehow lost 
by wrecked, we'll gladly prepare and send a new package. 
</p>

<b>if you don't see what you want</b><br>
if you see something listed and you're looking for it in
another format, let us know.  we specialize in vinyl,
but i can order alot of the vinyl releases on CD also,
and vice versa, some things on CD have a vinyl counterpart.
if you don't see something in stock, check out of stock,
we can do back order on most items within a week.  if its not
in the back stock, on order or forthcoming, you can still
send a request and we'll try to track it down.
